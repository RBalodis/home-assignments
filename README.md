# Home Assignments

## IMPORTANT ⚠️ ⚠️ ⚠️

For each and every assigment - carefully read requirements twice or more times if needed and before submission check that you have done **ALL** the things asked.

### README

Prepare a `README.MD` file which:

 - has an instructions on how to run your project
 - describes what you did, why you did it and how you would improve your submission ir more time would be given
 - if your solution has UI - record how your application works and add an animated `gif` at the **TOP** of your `README` file

### Repository Name and Visibility

Unless explicitly said to be `private`, keep your repository `public`.

**DO NOT** include company name in your repository description or name, if assignment is given by *4Finance*, then name your repository *micro-lending* or something like that.
