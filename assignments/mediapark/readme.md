### Create a small WEB API application that returns country public holidays.

#### Requirements for the Application:

1. Endpoints to implement:
- countries list
- grouped by a month holidays list for a given country and year
- specific day status(workday, free day, holiday)
- the maximum number of free(free day + holiday) days in a row, which will be by a given country and year
2. Endpoints should return JSON as a response.
3. To get a data(countries, holidays) your application should use a JSON API from https://kayaposoft.com/enrico/. Your application should avoid repeated requests to a https://kayaposoft.com/enrico/. Results from a https://kayaposoft.com/enrico/ should be normalized and saved to a database, so next time your application should query a database.
   
#### Requirements:

1. README.md with deployment instructions
2. Database - MSSQL
3. Version control - GIT(bitbucket, github or gitlab)
4. API documentation - generated with https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutor...
5. Deployment - project must be placed on the internet and publicly available (e.g. free hosting available at azure (12 months free tier))
