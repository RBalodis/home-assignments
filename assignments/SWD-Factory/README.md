# Front-end developer homework (Angular)

### Please find the description of 2 tasks we have been talking about today:
1. Fibonacci buckets calculation – description is in attached word document.
2. Static text analysis – calculate how many times each letter is repeated in entered text

Below is the mockup how the application should look.

## Task #1 - Fibonacci

Create a simple application using the following computer language (whichever) and platform (whichever) which should calculate Fibonacci sequence for given count of numbers. 
 
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two that precede it. Starting at 0 and 1, the sequence looks like this: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so on forever.
 
### Input:
The application should accept as an input the length of Fibonacci sequence (the count of Fibonacci which should be calculated for a sequence).
 
### Output:
The application should output in a screen calculated sequence with specified length.
 
### Example:
Input: sequence length=8
Output: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 
 
How the task should be delivered:
Source code of working application in a form of a zip archive or link to a repository in a github
