## Introduction

We create our designs and prototypes using Figma, so collaboration between front-end developers and designes takes place there. Currently, we use the following tech stack: HTML, SCSS, Bootstrap 4, jQyery, Gulp. We aim to use Vue.js on our website in the near future.

## Goal

To create 2 modal windows.

## Requirements

- Create a sing-in window using our current stack - HTML, SCSS, Bootstrap 4, jQyery, Gulp
- Create a sing-up window using Vue.js

Added files are devided into 3 parts: 
- Design - the design of all screens
- Prototype - where you will find transition (mivro animations) and component behavior
- Spec - some component states
