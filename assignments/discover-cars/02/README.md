## Requirements

Create a program that uses any text file with random content as an input, and checks all the words contained in such a text file for letter combinations consisting of more than 3 letters.
Program output will consist of up to 10 most common letter combinations and their difference in percentage displayed as a table and a bar chart.

Please do not use .NET Framework/Core features as much as you may. Please try to use only C# features.
Example: use for loop, instead of .Select Linq extensions
