## Task description

We provide a data set with 10 000 samples of historical loan applications. There are 83 initial data points (columns) that you should use for training, the target variable is fpd30 (FPD stands for First Payment Delay 30 days - 1 means that fpd30 is true and client defaulted, 0 means that fpd30 is false and the client paid back the loan)

The goal of the task is to build a classification model to predict whether the client will default or pay back the loan.

1. Do exploratory analysis on the given dataset.
1. Pre-process data for model training (encode features so they can be used for model training)
1. Train your chosen model or several models
1. Evaluate the feature importance
1. Evaluate the model performance
1. Propose the best model to use for credit scoring
1. Propose the cut-off (threshold) to use to achieve a 20% approval rate
1. You can use google colab notebook to perform this task: https://youtu.be/inN8seMm7UI
1. Use Python and pandas, anything else can be used to your own preference
1. Please document what you are doing by writing comments so it is easy to understand what is the intention and your thinking behind the code
1. You can use any ML library that you are comfortable with
