Objective: Create a simple PHP web application that allows users to view, add, and delete tasks. The application should use a MySQL database to store task information.

Requirements:
Database Setup:

Create a MySQL database named "task_manager"
Create a table named "tasks" with the following columns:
id (auto-incremented)
task_name (VARCHAR)
task_description (TEXT)

- Implement functionality to display a list of tasks from the database on the homepage.
- Include a form to add new tasks with fields for task_name and task_description.
- Implement a mechanism to delete tasks.

Frontend Development:

- Use HTML and CSS to create a simple and responsive user interface.
- Style the task list and form for adding new tasks.

Error Handling:
-Implement basic error handling for database connections and queries.
-Display appropriate error messages to the user when necessary.

Submission:

- Upload your code to a public GitHub/Gitlab repository.
- Include any additional notes or explanations about your implementation choices.

Submission will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- Correctness of the PHP code and MySQL queries.
- Proper error handling and validation.
- User interface design and responsiveness.
- Clarity and organization of the code.
- Adherence to best practices in PHP development.

Additional Notes:
